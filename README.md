## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a software developer with a strong focus on building **reliable, scalable, and high-quality applications**. I specialise in end-to-end development — from designing system architecture to delivering clean, user-focused interfaces.

My experience spans **full-stack development**, **distributed systems**, **microservices**, **real-time data pipelines**, and **performance-oriented backend engineering**.

I enjoy breaking down complex challenges, designing systems that scale, and bringing structure and clarity to fast-moving environments.
